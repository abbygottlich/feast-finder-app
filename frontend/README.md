Welcome to my first app!

This is a very simple application that was created to solve the biggest problem known to man...deciding where to go eat! Feast Finder is a restaurant generator that spits out a random restaurant for the user to try based on their inputs of their city and state. I created this app to not only ease the process of deciding where to eat, but also to keep track of restaurants that the user favorites and dislikes.

The restaurant information is fetched from the Yelp API. All user input is tracked and stored in mLab. This project also includes authentication so that users may sign in with their own credentials to view personal information.

Future functionality includes the ability to search through the user's favorites and dislikes by city, restaurant name, etc., the ability to fetch more than the first 50 restaurants from each city on Yelp, and additional error handling. I would also like to write some functionality that tests whether or not the user has favorited or disliked a restaurant, and if they disliked it, it will automatically re-fetch. Additionally, if the user has favorited the fetched restaurant, I would still like it to appear on the screen, but include the thumbs up icon with a favorited message to inform the user that they have already been there and like it. A few other pieces of functionality I'd like to add are not allowing duplicates in the Favorites and Dislikes lists and allowing the user to filter their search more by choosing their price range, food genre, etc.

Have fun generating and exploring your city's food scene!
